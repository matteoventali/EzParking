# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
The goal of this system is to create a parking sharing application that enables
users to find and share parking spaces in urban areas in order to reduce traffic congestion 
and environmental impact, and promoting collaboration among users.

In particular, the system will allow users to:
-   Share information about available parking spaces in real-time, including private and
    public spots.
-   Search for parking spaces near a specific location, with updates on availability (exploiting the geolocalization).
-   Reserve parking spaces, if applicable, based on user permissions.

The most important use cases are:
1. Finding a Parking Spot:
    A user opens the (web)app to locate available parking spaces within a specific radius.
    The app displays nearby spaces shared by other users, including details such
    as size, cost, and estimated walking distance.
2. Sharing a Parking Spot:
    A resident or business updates the app to mark their parking space as available.
3. Community Features:
    Users rate and review shared parking spots, contributing to a reputation system
    that helps identify reliable contributors of the system.
